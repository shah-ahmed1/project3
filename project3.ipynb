    "The developing community of Dunetown has decided to use a large lake located in the highlands near the town as their water supply.  To accomplish this, they have decided to install a steel pipe to bring the water from the lake to the town, as shown in the figure below.  The pipe should be capable of delivering a flow rate of $10000$ gallons per minute to the town in order to satisfy their present demand for water.\n",

    "You are an engineer in the Dunetown Department of Water Services and the department head has just charged you with determining the required diameter of the pipe.  She then hands you a list of tasks she would like to see completed in the analysis (See below).\n",

    "Complete the class `Dunetown` below by writing a member function `friction_factor()` to compute the friction factor for pipe flow.\n",
    "\n",
    " * The function should return a floating point number (not a NumPy array) that is the friction factor $f$.  The function takes two input arguments, the flow Reynold's number $Re$ and optionally, the pipe roughness ratio $\\varepsilon / D$.  If the roughness ratio is omitted, use a default of zero, a smooth pipe.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Use the laminar friction factor when $Re < 2000$ and the Colebrook friction factor otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Use Newton's method to iterate the Colebrook formula.  Terminate the iteration when the approximate relative error is less than $10^8$.  Use the initial guess given to start your iteration.  With this starting point, your function should always converge.\n",
    "\n",
    " * If you think about it carefully, a change of variables makes your function for Newton's method easier to write.\n",
    " \n",
    " * You can write your own Newton's method implementation or use SciPy's [`scipy.optimize.fsolve`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.fsolve.html) function.  If you use `fsolve` be sure to include the optional argument `fprime` so that it uses Newton's method and not the Secant Method.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Task 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Write another member function called `pipeflow()` to solve the energy balance.\n",
    "\n",
    " * This function should have one argument, the pipe diameter $D$ in units of meters and return the average velocity in the pipe $V$ in meters per second.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Use any root finding method you choose to solve for the velocity in the energy balance.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Use a relative error of $10^{-8}$.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Test your function with a test diameter of $D=0.1$ m.  The average velocity for this case is $V=1.080244$ $\\mbox{m}/\\mbox{s}$.\n",
    " \n",
    " * The constants needed to carry out the calculations are already stored as class attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the member function `pipe_selector()`.  There is a class attribute called `pipe_sizes` that contains a dictionary of standard schedule 40 (SH40) pipe sizes.  The keywords in the dictionary are the \"nominal\" pipe sizes and the values are the actual inner diameter of the pipes (what we need to use to size the pipe for the flowrate).  Use the other functions you wrote and the `pipe_sizes` dictionary to determine the *smallest* nominal pipe size (an integer) that is adequate for the 10000 gal/min water demand.  `pipe_selector()` should return this pipe size.  **Note:** All of the other calculations should be accomplished in SI units.  We only convert to English units in this last step to size the pipe which are described and sold by their nominal sizes in inches."
